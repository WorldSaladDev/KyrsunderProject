            <h2>About Kyrsunder & Estara</h2>
            <p>
                Kyrsunder is the name given to this universe and the ancient event that shaped it:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"At the dawn of existence, when the cosmos was a roiling storm of senseless chaos, the primordial
                beings known as the Wills wove a sigil of incomprehensible scale, a cosmic pattern formed by galactic
                filaments, the spin of particles, and the flow of time. This spell, the Kyrsunder, stilled the endlessly
                shifting cosmos, stripped the Wills of their power, and established the physical laws that govern all of
                existence."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Among its countless worlds, Estara is of special interest. As an Earth-like planet home to intelligent bipedal
                organisms rather similar to humans, Estara makes the perfect starting point to explore Kyrsunder, and is the 
                focal point of many of the stories told here.
